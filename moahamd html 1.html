        <h1>random text origin</h1>
        <p>Lorem Ipsum comes from a latin text written in 45BC by Roman statesman, lawyer, scholar, and philosopher,
            Marcus Tullius Cicero. The text is titled "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" which means "The Extremes of Good
            and Evil". The most common form of Lorem ipsum is the following:

            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et
            dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex
            ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat
            nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit
            anim id est laborum.

            The text is a corrupted version of the original and therefore does not mean anything in particular. The book
            however where it originates discusses the philosophical views of Epicureanism, Stoicism, and the Platonism
            of Antiochus of Ascalon.

            Lorem ipsum is widely in use since the 14th century and up to today as the default dummy "random" text of
            the typesetting and web development industry. In fact not only it has survived the test of time but it
            thrived and can be found in many software products, from Microsoft Word to WordPress.</p>
        <h2>why they created it?</h2>
        <p>This tool was created because we wanted random text for our web designs. When we show a design to a client we
            want to have some text that doesn't mean anything in particular just to indicate that "here is where the
            text will be". So why shouldn't we just copy-paste a single sentence and get a block of text ? Have a look
            at the following examples:

            This is some dummy text. This is some dummy text. This is some dummy text. This is some dummy text. This is
            some dummy text. This is some dummy text. This is some dummy text. This is some dummy text. This is some
            dummy text. This is some dummy text.
            This is a single sentence repeated a few times.
        </p>
        <h3>Why not use lorem ipsum ?</h3>
        <p>Lorem ipsum is the most common form of "Greeking". However more and more people are sick and tired of using
            the same sample text over and over again. Also lorem ipsum is in latin and it may not always be the best
            choice. We tried to have text generated in some of the most widely used languages but if you are in
            desperate need of random text in your own language, send us an email and we'll add it here.</p>
